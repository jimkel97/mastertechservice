				<h1>Contractor's R&eacute;sum&eacute;</h1>
				<p>Gary, the Qualifying Contractor, owner, and founder of Master-Tech Service, LLC is a "hands-on" individual, and has been directly involved in HVAC&amp;R service, maintenance, repair, and installation right here in Central Florida since 1981. Having passed the rigorous Block &amp; Associates air conditioning contractor's exam at the age of 18 back in 1984 (State Reg. &num;RA 0056831), he later founded Contemporary Air Service, Inc. (1985-2003) and went onward to become a State Certified Air Conditioning Contractor. (State Lic. &num;CAC 1816244)</p>
				<p>Gary possesses the knowledge, experience, technical skills, expertise, and desire to inspect and flawlessly care for all aspects of your commercial or residential HVAC/R equipment; from installation, to preventive maintenance, to repairs and service, Gary's passion for excellence is matched only by his drive for mechanical perfection.</p>
				<p>With OVER 29 YEARS EXPERIENCE and MORE THAN 35,000 SERVICE CALLS&reg; under his belt, you can count on Gary to do the job right the first time around, because he services each piece of equipment as his own, and treats each customer as if they were the only one. This commitment and dedicative mindset is firmly rooted within his morals and spiritual alignment, with the belief and conviction that every job should be done as if it were unto God himself. (Colossians 3:23)</p>
				<p>Your repair service, new installation, and preventive maintenance inspections are backed by a long history of experience and technical acumen; so when you encounter difficult equipment problems that seem impossible to solve, it's nice to know that Gary's Master-Tech Service will be there to properly diagnose the issue and resolve it quickly, without breaking the bank.</p>
